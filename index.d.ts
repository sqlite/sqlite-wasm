 * This support is only available when sqlite3.js is loaded from a Worker
 * thread, whether it's loaded in its own dedicated worker or in a worker
 * together with client code. This OPFS wrapper implements an `sqlite3_vfs`
 * wrapper entirely in JavaScript.
 *
 * This feature is activated automatically if the browser appears to have the
 * necessary APIs to support it. It can be tested for in JS code using one of:
 *
 *     If(sqlite3.capi.sqlite3_vfs_find("opfs")){ ... OPFS VFS is available ... }
 *     // Alternately: if(sqlite3.oo1.OpfsDb){ ... OPFS VFS is available ... }
 *
 * If it is available, the VFS named `"opfs"` can be used with any sqlite3 APIs
 * which accept a VFS name, such as `sqlite3_vfs_find()`,
 * `sqlite3_db_open_v2()`, and the `sqlite3.oo1.DB` constructor, noting that
 * {@link OpfsDb} is a convenience subclass of {@link Database} which
 * automatically uses this VFS. For URI-style names, use `file:my.db?vfs=opfs`.
 *
 * ## ⚠️Achtung: Safari versions < 17:
 *
 * Safari versions less than version 17 are incompatible with the current OPFS
 * VFS implementation because of a bug in storage handling from sub-workers.
 * There is no workaround for that - supporting it will require a separate VFS
 * implementation and we do not, as of July 2023, have an expected time frame
 * for its release. Both the `SharedAccessHandle` pool VFS and the WASMFS
 * support offers alternatives which should work with Safari versions 16.4 or
 * higher.
 *
 * ## ⚠️Achtung: COOP and COEP HTTP Headers
 *
 * In order to offer some level of transparent concurrent-db-access support,
 * JavaScript's SharedArrayBuffer type is required for the OPFS VFS, and that
 * class is only available if the web server includes the so-called COOP and
 * COEP response headers when delivering scripts:
 *
 *     Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
 *     Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
 *
 * Without these headers, the `SharedArrayBuffer` will not be available, so the
 * OPFS VFS will not load. That class is required in order to coordinate
 * communication between the synchronous and asynchronous parts of the
 * `sqlite3_vfs` OPFS proxy.
 *
 * The COEP header may also have a value of `credentialless`, but whether or not
 * that will work in the context of any given application depends on how it uses
 * other remote assets.
 *
 * How to emit those headers depends on the underlying web server.

   * Getting/Setting Memory Values
   * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * The WASM memory heap is exposed to JS as a byte array of memory which is
   * made to appear contiguous (though it's really allocated in chunks). Given
   * a byte-oriented view of the heap, it is possible to read and write
   * individual bytes of the heap, just like in C:
   *
   *    const X = wasm.heap8u(); // a uint8-oriented view of the heap
   *    X[someAddress] = 0x2a;
   *    console.log( X[someAddress] ); // ==> 42
   *
   * Obviously, writing arbitrary addresses can corrupt the WASM heap, just like in
   * C, so one has to be careful with the memory addresses the work with (just like
   * in C!).
   *
   *  Tip: it is important never to hold on to objects returned from methods
   *  like `heap8u()` long-term, as they may be invalidated if the heap grows.
   *  It is acceptable to hold the reference for a brief series of calls, so
   *  long as those calls are guaranteed not to allocate memory on the WASM
   *  heap, but it should never be cached for later use.
   *
   * Before describing the routines for manipulating the heap, we first need
   * to look at data type descriptors, sometimes referred to as "IR" (internal
   * representation). These are short strings which identify the specific data
   * types supported by WASM and/or the JS/WASM glue code:
   *
   * - `i8`: 8-bit signed integer
   * - `i16`: 16-bit signed integer
   * - `i32`: 32-bit signed integer. Aliases: `int`, `*`, `**` (noting that
   *    `*` and `**` may be remapped dynamically to to i64 when WASM environments
   *    gain 64-bit pointer capabilities).
   * - `i64`: 64-bit signed integer. APIs which use this require that the
   *    application has been built with BigInt support, and will throw if that is
   *    not the case.
   * - `f32`: 32-bit floating point value. Alias: float
   * - `f64`: 64-bit floating point value. Alias: double
   *
   * These are used extensively by the memory accessor APIs and need to be
   * committed to memory.

   *
   * Additionally, it's often useful to add new functions to the WASM runtime

   * **The list of built-in names.**

   * - `i8`, `i16`, `i32` (args and results): all integer conversions which
   *   convert their argument to an integer and truncate it to the given bit
   *   length.
   * - `N*` (args): a type name in the form `N*`, where N is a numeric type name,
   *   is treated the same as WASM pointer.
   * - `*` and `pointer` (args): are assumed to be opaque WASM pointers and are
   *   treated like the current WASM pointer numeric type. Non-numbers will
   *   coerce to a value of 0 and out-of-range numbers will have `undefined`
   *   results (as with any pointer misuse).
   * - `*` and `pointer` (results): are aliases for the current WASM pointer
   *   numeric type.
   * - `**` (args): is simply a descriptive alias for `'*'`. It's primarily
   *   intended to mark output-pointer arguments.
   * - `i64` (args and results): passes the value to `BigInt()` to convert it to
   *   an `int64`. Only available if `BigInt` support is enabled.
   * - `f32` (float), `f64` (double) (args and results): pass their argument to
   *   `Number()`. i.e. the adapter does not currently distinguish between the
   *   two types of floating-point numbers.
   * - `number` (results): converts the result to a JS Number using
   *   `Number(theValue).valueOf()`. Note that this is for result conversions
   *   only, as it's not possible to generically know which type of number to
   *   convert arguments to.
   *
   * Non-numeric conversions include:
   *
   * - `string` or `utf8` (args): has two different semantics in order to
   *   accommodate various uses of certain C APIs...
   *
   *   - If the arg is a JS string, a temporary C-string, UTF-8 encoded, is created
   *       to pass to the exported function, which gets cleaned up before the
   *       wrapper returns. If a long-lived C-string pointer is required,
   *       client-side code is required to create the string, then pass its
   *       pointer to the function.
   *   - Else the arg is assumed to be a pointer to a string the client has already
   *       allocated and it's passed on as a WASM pointer.
   * - `string` or `utf8` (results): treats the result value as a const C-string,
   *   encoded as UTF-8, copies it to a JS string, and returns that JS string.
   * - `string:dealloc` or `utf8:dealloc` (results): treats the result value as a
   *   non-const C-string, encoded as UTF-8, ownership of which has just been
   *   transfered to the caller. It copies the C-string to a JS string, frees
   *   the C-string using `dealloc()`, and returns the JS string. If such a
   *   result value is NULL, the JS result is null. **Achtung:** when using an
   *   API which returns results from a specific allocator, this conversion is
   *   not legal. Instead, an equivalent conversion which uses the appropriate
   *   deallocator is required. An example of such is provided in the next
   *   section.
   * - `string:flexible` (args): are an expanded version of `string` described in
   *   the C-style API docs. These are widely used for SQL string inputs in the
   *   library.
   * - `string:static` (args): if passed a pointer, returns it as is. Anything
   *   else: gets coerced to a JS string for use as a map key. If a matching
   *   entry is found (as described next), it is returned, else
   *   `wasm.allocCString()` is used to create a a new string, map its pointer
   *   to `(''+v)` for the remainder of the application's life, and returns that
   *   pointer value for this call and all future calls which are passed a
   *   string-equivalent argument. This conversion is intended for cases which
   *   require static/long-lived string arguments, e.g. `sqlite3_bind_pointer()`
   *   and `sqlite3_result_pointer()`.
   * - `json` (results): treats the result as a const C-string and returns the
   *   result of passing the converted-to-JS string to `JSON.parse()`. Returns
   *   `null` if the C-string is a NULL pointer. Propagates any exception from
   *   `JSON.parse()`.
   * - `json:dealloc` (results): works exactly like `string:dealloc` but returns
   *   the same thing as the json adapter. Note the warning in `string:dealloc`
   *   about the allocator and deallocator.
   *
   * The type names for results and arguments are validated when `xWrap()` is
   * called and any unknown names will trigger an exception.
   *
   * Clients may map their own result and argument adapters using
   * `xWrap.resultAdapter()` and `xWrap.argAdaptor()`, noting that not all type
   * conversions are valid for both arguments and result types as they often
   * have different memory ownership requirements. That topic is covered in the
   * next section...
   *
   * **Argument and Result Value Type Conversions**
   *
   * When `xWrap()` is called and evaluates function call signatures, it looks
   * up the argument and result type adapters for a match. It is possible to
   * install custom adapters for arguments and result values using the methods
   * listed below.
   *
   * `xWrap()` has two methods with identical signatures:
   *
   *     xWrap.argAdapter(string, function)
   *     xWrap.resultAdapter(string, function)
   *
   * Each one expects a type name string, such as the ones described for
   * `xWrap()`, and a function which is passed a single value and must return
   * that value, a conversion of that value, or throw an exception. Each of
   * those functions returns itself so that calls may be chained.
   *
   * For example's sake, let's assume we have a C-bound function which returns a
   * C-style string allocated using a non-default allocator, `my_str_alloc()`.
   * The returned memory is owned by the caller and must be freed, but needs to
   * be freed using the allocator's deallocation counterpart, `my_str_free()`.
   * We can create such a result value adapter with:
   *
   *     wasm.xWrap.resultAdaptor('my_str_alloc*', (v)=>{
   *       try { return v ? target.cstrToJs(v) : null }
   *       finally{ wasm.exports.my_str_free(v) }
   *     };
   *
   * With that in place, we can make calls like:
   *
   *     const f = wasm.xWrap('my_function', 'my_str_alloc*', [
   *       'i32',
   *       'string',
   *     ]);
   *     const str = f(17, 'hello, world');
   *     // ^^^ the memory allocated for the result using my_str_alloc()
   *     //     is freed using my_str_free() before f() returns.
   *
   * Similarly, let's assume that we have a custom JS class which has a member
   * property named `pointer` which refers to C-side memory of a struct which
   * this JS class represents. We can then make it legal to pass such objects on
   * to the C APIs with something like:
   *
   *     const argPointer = wasm.xWrap.argAdapter('*'); // default pointer-type adapter
   *     wasm.xWrap.argAdaptor('MyType', (v) => {
   *       if (v instanceof MyType) v = v.pointer;
   *       if (wasm.isPtr(v)) return argPointer(v);
   *       throw new Error('Invalid value for MyType argument.');
   *     });
   *
   * With that in place we can wrap one of our functions like:
   *
   *     const f = wasm.xWrap('MyType_method', undefined, ['MyType', 'i32']);
   *     const my = new MyType(...);
   *     // ^^^ assume this allocates WASM memory referenced via my.pointer.
   *     f( my, // will use my.pointer
   *        17 );
   *
   * Similar conversions can be done for result values, though how to do so for
   * result values depends entirely on client-side semantics of memory
   * management.
